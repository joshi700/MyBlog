### Central Business Intelligence and Service Delivery Framework

SYNOPSIS 
	• Poised for significant growth, First Foundation Bank needed to transform cumbersome, manual, and siloed systems and processes to ensure that processes could accommodate an influx of new customers and employees. 
	• With future acquisition and organic growth part of its long-term goals, the bank needed to take advantage of automation and technology to sustain collaboration and excellent customer service. 
	• The Vault is a business intelligence delivery framework that supports automated processing of client and internal service requests, collaboration for scaling Change Management, Project Management, Product Management, Risk Management, and Data/Content Management. 
	• It supports centralized team workspaces that let it track and resolve issues, post announcements, distribute critical alerts, and effectively govern enterprise communications.

KEY BENEFITS 
	• The bank has automated over 75% of its highest-volume processes and completely overhauled its intranet. 
	• The Vault is staged to integrate AI and robotic utilities to bridge gaps in hands-off processing. 
	• Clients and employees enjoy an enterprise delivery platform that leverages data to auto fill forms, drive automation, and electronically deliver services to clients. 
	• Grew assets by 78% while employee count grew by only 40%

How it was designed
	• It changes the fundamental operations of the bank by focusing on how employees do their work and deliver an improved customer experience, its implementation is extraordinarily effective.
	• First Foundation leveraged integration and new technology to scale its service delivery and overall business intelligence by improving enterprise data and process accessibility and integrating banking processes and business support applications. 

Product Roadmap
	• Identify redundant or missing features
	• Build product versions and roadmap
	• Analyze and prioritize features

Problem
	• To fulfil its ambitions of organic growth and acquisitions, First Foundation’s management knew that it had to radically restructure its approach to 
		○ Data management
		○ Employee collaboration
		○ Assimilation of new customers and colleagues 
	• Too many critical processes were manual and paper driven, which caused delays in service to clients and also exposed the bank to increasing risk as it grew larger 
	• The bank tracked customer requests through email, which required numerous redundant emails and offered no real time insight into the status of the requests 
	• Email-based processes created challenges for both customer service and audit 
	• Processes were person-dependent, so the absence of an individual could hold up processing of a request 
	• Processes also required excessive documentation, which was a drain on employee time and consumed network bandwidth and storage 
	• There was no way to objectively assess employee performance, or to understand and then correct bottlenecks and inefficiencies 
	• Serving customers involved working in various applications 
	• After all steps were completed to process the customer request, related documents had to be manually archived
