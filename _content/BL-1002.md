### Central Business Intelligence and Service Delivery Framework

---

## SYNOPSIS
- Poised for significant growth, First Foundation Bank needed to transform cumbersome, manual, and siloed systems and processes to ensure that processes could accommodate an influx of new customers and employees.
- With future acquisition and organic growth as part of its long-term goals, the bank needed to take advantage of automation and technology to sustain collaboration and excellent customer service.
- **The Vault** is a business intelligence delivery framework that supports automated processing of client and internal service requests, collaboration for scaling Change Management, Project Management, Product Management, Risk Management, and Data/Content Management.
- It supports centralized team workspaces that allow tracking and resolving issues, posting announcements, distributing critical alerts, and effectively governing enterprise communications.

## KEY BENEFITS
- The bank has automated over 75% of its highest-volume processes and completely overhauled its intranet.
- The Vault is staged to integrate AI and robotic utilities to bridge gaps in hands-off processing.
- Clients and employees enjoy an enterprise delivery platform that leverages data to auto-fill forms, drive automation, and electronically deliver services to clients.
- Grew assets by 78% while employee count grew by only 40%.

## How it was designed
- It changes the fundamental operations of the bank by focusing on how employees do their work and deliver an improved customer experience, making its implementation extraordinarily effective.
- First Foundation leveraged integration and new technology to scale its service delivery and overall business intelligence by improving enterprise data and process accessibility and integrating banking processes and business support applications.

## Product Roadmap
- Identify redundant or missing features.
- Build product versions and roadmap.
- Analyze and prioritize features.

---

## Problem
- To fulfill its ambitions of organic growth and acquisitions, First Foundation’s management knew that it had to radically restructure its approach to:
  - Data management
  - Employee collaboration
  - Assimilation of new customers and colleagues
- Too many critical processes were manual and paper-driven, which caused delays in service to clients and also exposed the bank to increasing risk as it grew larger.
- The bank tracked customer requests through email, which required numerous redundant emails and offered no real-time insight into the status of the requests.
- Email-based processes created challenges for both customer service and audits.
- Processes were person-dependent, so the absence of an individual could hold up the processing of a request.
- Processes also required excessive documentation, which was a drain on employee time and consumed network bandwidth and storage.
- There was no way to objectively assess employee performance or to understand and correct bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Serving customers involved working in various applications.
- After all steps were completed to process the customer request, related documents had to be manually archived.

# The Vault

The Vault is a business intelligence delivery framework that supports automated processing of client and internal service requests, together with collaboration for scaling:

- Change Management
- Project Management
- Product Management
- Risk Management
- Data/Content Management

It also supports centralized team workspaces to more effectively:

- Track and resolve issues
- Post announcements
- Critical alerts
- Provide general enterprise communication governance

## Implementation

- We had to examine processes across the bank and determine how to change them to deliver a more resilient business service model — automating existing processes would not suffice.
- It required substantial changes for staff in how they communicate, interact, collaborate, and perform their jobs.
- The team devoted a significant amount of time upfront on requirements design for sites, forms, automated workflows, servicing, and reporting dashboards.
- Importantly, the team also tested the prototype with the business units to ensure they were engaged in the design and development.
- First Foundation converted three acquired financial institutions during the implementation of this initiative, nearly tripling its number of branches.

## Functionality

- The Vault’s framework eliminates the silos separating the business processing and client servicing applications to create a more seamless experience for staff and clients.
- The Vault also shares data with the financial institution’s other holding groups and systems (i.e., three loan origination systems (LOS), wealth management, etc.).
- The Vault was also staged to integrate AI and robotic utilities to bridge gaps in hands-off processing.
- Clients and employees enjoy an enterprise delivery platform that leverages data to autofill forms, drive automation, and electronically service clients. Searching for a customer, for example, is now trivial.

## Benefits

- The ability to give complex client relationships automated case and issue management lets the bank gain more business from these clients.
- It has also reduced the burden on clients themselves by eliminating manual efforts to execute bank service request processes (no more manual forms for each account service request).
- Internal communications have also improved.
- Post-acquisition, newly acquired employees were able to read updates about the merger in The Vault.
- The finance team moved off a spreadsheet system to create reports for senior leadership in the new framework.
- Employees are encouraged to do "everything" through The Vault.
- Even birthdays for employees were pushed there (instead of the spreadsheet that used to be mailed around).

## Results

- The bank has automated more than 75% of the highest-volume processes and completely overhauled its internal intranet.
- It leverages The Vault to provide a more dynamic environment, effectively deploy changes, measure their risk, and more consistently deploy project management methodologies.
- From the start of this initiative to September 2019, assets grew by 78% while employee count grew by only 40% because of efficiencies and automation.
- As First Foundation grows, it no longer needs to proportionally add staff resources.
- The framework has automated manual processes and allowed the bank to repurpose the efforts of 15 staff to more critical and fulfilling objectives.
- Ninety-nine percent of internal processes were updated and enhanced to work at optimal efficiency in the new environment.
- Approximately 50% of weekly/daily management reports are now in SharePoint, with the goal of 100% by Q1 2020.
- Risk management is now more efficient and accurate.
- With the processes and automation in place, audits, FDIC reviews, or any other risk control requirements are accommodated without resource disruption.

- Clients receive faster service and turnaround times because everything streams through the enterprise framework — clean, fast, and consistent automated workflows.
- The bank has grown relationships because of its elevated service, a direct result of creating this framework and business service layer.

## Future Plans

- First Foundation plans to continue to improve and expand its digital offerings now that it has the enterprise framework and integrated business service layer to support an elevated digital customer experience.
- Adding Commercial Center℠ from Fiserv will be one offering for complex business clients.
- Originate Deposits from Fiserv for online account opening will be another addition that provides instant access to the online channel to attract new accountholders.
- The bank also plans to add Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with an AI plug-in, and will create hooks for automation components to be layered into the SharePoint handoff through critical Fiserv applications using the Blue Prism application.
- Finally, First Foundation has created an enterprise data warehouse that incorporates data from multiple sources and uses SharePoint as an information distribution and administration mechanism across the organization.
- This universal data warehouse has a Microsoft SQL back end.
- One element of the overall stack is a new data warehouse solution from Fiserv, for which First Foundation served as a beta client.
- Whereas 90% of the bank’s applications are hosted in the Fiserv cloud, its enterprise data warehouse will soon be moving to Azure.
