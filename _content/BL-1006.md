# Steps for Authorizing Transactions In-Flight

1. **Offline or Delayed Connectivity Challenge**  
   - Onboard transactions use a combination of offline processing and real-time authorization (when connectivity is available).

2. **Card Details Collection**  
   - The passenger provides their payment card details (via swiping, inserting, tapping, or manual entry).  
   - If using contactless payment methods like Apple Pay or Google Pay, these systems tokenize the payment details securely.

3. **Authorization Process (Offline Authorization):**  
   - The transaction is stored locally in an encrypted format.  
   - When the plane lands or connects to a ground server, the POS system uploads these transactions for batch processing.  
   - Transactions undergo authorization at this stage, with a small risk of declined payments if the cardholder lacks funds or the card is invalid.

4. **Fraud Mitigation for Offline Transactions**  
   - **Pre-authorization Checks:** Verifying card details using stored BIN ranges or simple validity checks before accepting an offline transaction.  
   - **Transaction Limits:** Setting spending caps for offline payments (e.g., $50 per transaction).

5. **Passenger Notification**  
   - For offline transactions, customers may not receive confirmation until after the flight when the transaction is authorized on the ground.

6. **Settlement and Reconciliation**  
   - Once all transactions are authorized, the airline's payment processor settles funds into the airlineâ€™s accounts.
